# Getting Started 

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

This is a very simple React App created by following [this](https://www.udemy.com/course/complete-react-native-mobile-development-zero-to-mastery-with-hooks/) course. I am interested in creating React Native Apps and since the course included a short course on React, it was recommended to start with React to understand certain common themes such as: 

* Components and how they are the responsible for state
* One way data flow (everything flows from state to props) 
* general eco-system of React
* Error boundaries
* Hooks

I have also saved a [`classes` branch](https://github.com/ollyc2015/react-simple-example/tree/classes) that uses the original way to handle state before `hooks` were introduced. This is good to know if you're not too interested in strict React, since `hooks` are a React only feature, where as classes are used in JavaScript too.

Once you have cloned or forked the project, you can run the project by doing the following:

1. Run `npm install`
2. Run `npm start`
